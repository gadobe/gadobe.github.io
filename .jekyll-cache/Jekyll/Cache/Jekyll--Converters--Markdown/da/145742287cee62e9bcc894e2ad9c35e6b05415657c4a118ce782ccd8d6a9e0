I"⁄<p>This post contains a 3-item checklist to consider to comply and ideas to future-proof your Adobe implementations in 2020.</p>

<h2 id="1-dtm-update-to-adobe-launch">1. DTM Update to Adobe Launch</h2>
<p>DTM sunset is on-going and the first milestone ‚Äúnew properties disabled‚Äù has passed. There are multiple guides floating around to facilitate the planning.</p>

<p>Key Dates (already been extended by 6 months):</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Milestone</th>
      <th>Deadline</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Option to create new DTM properties no longer available</td>
      <td>July 9, 2019</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>All DTM properties become read-only</td>
      <td>July 14, 2020</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>DTM servers go to sleep</td>
      <td>January 12, 2021</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>DTM has been around for years, this means that there might be redundant or legacy code/methods. The level of effort for a migration will depend on the implementation ‚Äústyle‚Äù, tracked events and third-party tags.</p>

<h2 id="2-cname-tracking-server-implementation">2. CName Tracking Server Implementation</h2>
<p>With all the changes to cross-domain tracking in the last 12 months by browsers such as Safari (ITP), CName tracking server implementations are a must.
This is required to ensure that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>attribution is not affected</li>
  <li>visitor metrics are persisted and not inflated</li>
  <li>segmentation and personalisation is maintained</li>
</ul>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Solution</th>
      <th>Method</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Adobe Analytics (AA)</td>
      <td>CName Tracking server must be implemented as part of ECID library and AA (Appmeasurement) code<sup>1</sup>.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Adobe Audience Manager (AAM)</td>
      <td>If AA is not present, must be implemented as part of ECID library<sup>1</sup>.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Adobe Target (AT)</td>
      <td>Request and implement first-party certificate for AT requests<sup>2</sup>.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h2 id="3-consent-management">3. Consent Management</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation">GDPR</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Consumer_Privacy_Act">CCPA</a>, the data regulation in your region is when rather than an if. The common trend of to collect consent and allow users to opt-out<sup>3</sup>.</p>

<p>Adobe Launch can facilitate the implementation of three Consent Management extensions: Evidon, TrustArc, OneTrust.
<img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/posts/001-adobe_launch_consent_management_extension.png" alt="image-center" class="align-center" /></p>

<p>Alternatively, your developers will have to build this functionality in-house and decide when to trigger data collection based on the user consent<sup>4</sup>.</p>

<p>My recommendation is to start the discussion with your legal teams to identify a potential consent and opt-out framework.</p>
